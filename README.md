# vim-bundle-extension

This is an vim bundle extending several vim bundles I use. Currently included extensions are:

1. promptline: add a new powerlinesh-new theme.
2. ale: add vale linter for asciidoc, c and python.

Use `vim-plug` to add to vimrc:

```vim
Plug 'ProgramFan/vim-bundle-extension'
```
